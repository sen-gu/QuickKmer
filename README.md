# QuickKmer
A Quick Searching Method for K-Length DNA Substring(K-mer)

## Background
This Project is designed for a quick searching method for a K-length DNA substring. As known to us All, the DNA sequence only contain 4 different characters, which are the 'A', 'G', 'T', and it is different from normal text, and have more possibitily to improve the performance.

To achieve the best performance, we design this Searching Method by Double-Level Hash Index.

This Project and test date is provided by Beijing Genomics institution in 2015 Shenzhen Cup Mathematica Modeling. 

All of the codes are written in 2015 and only takes about 1 month, which may have many weakens. We won't update the code any more. If you want to improve it, you can have a try in the following aspects.

* Add Support for HardDisk Store. 
* Add Support for Multithreading.
* Change the Algrorithm when searching a long substring.
